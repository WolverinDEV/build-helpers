# - Try to find unbound include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(unbound)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  unbound_ROOT_DIR          Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            unbound if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  unbound_FOUND             System has unbound, include and library dirs found
#  unbound_INCLUDE_DIR       The unbound include directories.
#  unbound_LIBRARIES_STATIC  The unbound libraries.
#  unbound_LIBRARIES_SHARED  The unbound libraries.
